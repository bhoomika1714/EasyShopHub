## **INTRODUCTION**

The selected project revolves around the development of algorithms and tools aimed at
assisting businesses in designing, managing, and optimizing their warehouses. This
initiative seeks to enhance overall efficiency, reduce operational costs, and minimize the
environmental impact associated with warehouse operations. The domain encompasses a
multidisciplinary approach, incorporating elements of logistics, supply chain management,
and environmental sustainability. Efficient warehouse management is pivotal for
businesses to meet customer demands, streamline operations, and remain competitive in
the dynamic market landscape.

## **Problem Statement**

### Domain

**Can we develop algorithms and tools to help businesses design, manage, and optimize
their warehouses in order to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and minimize
environmental impact?**


The chosen need statement asks if we can create tools and algorithms to help
businesses run their warehouses betterâ€”making them more efficient, cost-effective,
and environmentally friendly. The motivation behind this choice is the noticeable
challenges companies face in managing warehouses amid a constantly changing
market and the need to reduce environmental impact. Traditional methods are falling
short, and there's a clear demand for smart solutions that not only improve operations
and cut costs but also align with efforts to be more environmentally conscious.
Warehouses are crucial in supply chains, and enhancing their design and management
can bring significant advantages. By addressing this need, the project aims to offer
practical solutions that cater to the current challenges in the logistics and supply chain
industry while promoting sustainability. I am an Amazon Future Engineer Scholar , I
had got an opportunity to visit the Amazon Office in Bengaluru , when I had been there
we had the session wherein we were introduced to Amazon warehouses , the
Warehouse Manager gave us a glimpse of how the things are managed in there and
what all hurdles they used to faced and how tough was it for them during the COVID
time . Since , I had seen all these things it motivated me to work towards this.
